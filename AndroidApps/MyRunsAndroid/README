This application is a simple fitness app for Android. It allows you to capture your runs and walks and view the stats on Google Maps. It uses sensors (viz. GPS, accelerometers) in the phone to infer your activity (e.g., running) in an automatic manner. The app comprises a client that runs on the phone and a backend cloud component using Google App Engine. Runs can be entered in manually, via GPS, or automatically (type of activity is determined by the accelerometer).  Past runs can be viewed in the history page as well as on the server.
