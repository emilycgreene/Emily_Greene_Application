This Android application was developed with Dani Gnibus, Jason Feng, and Nick Fiacco.


Overview:
Hate when you’re the first person to arrive to a meeting place and proceed to wait by yourself for the next 20 minutes? Ever sit awkwardly in a restaurant trying not to let anyone see you’re sitting alone while you’re friends take their time getting there? Well now with OnTime, you and your friends can always arrive simultaneously!

This application will use location services to help you coordinate arriving at the same time as your friends.  As you and your friends proceed towards a destination, you can see everyone’s progress towards the location of the event through visual bars on the event’s page.
