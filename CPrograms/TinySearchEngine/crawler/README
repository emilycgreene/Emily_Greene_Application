This component of the Tiny Search Engine is meant to crawl the web and download html files for each URL to a directory specified by the user.  The Dartmouth CS department provides students with a set of webpages to crawl so as not to disturb other web servers.  The root URL is http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse/ . This program can be run at a variety of depths. Depth 1 is just the webpages linked to by the root.  Depth 2 is the webpages linked to by the root and by the webpages in Depth 1.  Additional depths are crawled similarly.  Due to the quantity of webpages in Depth 3, fully crawling all of these pages will take around 1.5 hrs.

To run the crawler component:
./crawler http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse/ directory/ depth

Where directory is the directory in which you would like to put the results (must make the directory first) and depth is the depth level you would like to run (1-3)
