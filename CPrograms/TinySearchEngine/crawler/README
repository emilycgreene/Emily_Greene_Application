I used a Mac OS X 10.8 computer to complete this assignment.

The assumptions that I made are that the crawlerTest.sh script would be run in the same directory as the Makefile. Additionally, I assumed that my current directory structure would not be changed for any reason (all the .c and .h files are in the src folder).

I assumed that any user running the crawlerTest.sh wanted the three directories created (test1, test2, and test3 for depths 1-3 respectively) to be deleted at the end of the script, in addition to make clean. Therefore, the only new file remaining after calling ./crawlerTest.sh is the CrawlerTestLog.

I assumed that the seedPage would be considered depth 0 and the crawler would crawl up to and including maxDepth (but would not crawl the pages at maxDepth for valid URLs).

crawlerTest.sh will print to the console when it is finishing crawling at depths 1, 2, and 3.  It does not print to the console for the initial error testing.

The only thing that crawlerTest.sh prints to the log file after crawling at depths 1, 2, and 3 is the return code (whether the crawl ran successfully).
