I used crawlerTest.sh to test crawler.  The shell script has the following testswithin it: 

No command line arguments provided
One command line argument provided
Two command line arguments provided
Invalid directory provided
Invalid URL provided
maxDepth not provided as an integer
Proper command line inputs, crawling at depth 1
Proper command line inputs, crawling at depth 2
Proper command line inputs, crawling at depth 3

crawlerTest.sh returns the results of these tests to CrawlerTestLog.DATE where DDATE is the date/time that the shell script was executed.

I also created a makefile called Makefile to compile the code.
